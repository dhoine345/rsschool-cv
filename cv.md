## About me:
I want to grow as a Web developer. A year ago, it became my dream, and I am making my dream come true.
I see life as a set of decisions made and their consequences. That's why I love programming - everything has a cause and effect, and in programming this is most clearly manifested.
I get positive emotions by solving new tasks.

## My skills:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Git
* Node.js
* BEM
* Figma
* Webpack
* MongoDB
* React
* Express.js

## Code examples
```
function handleMouseEnter(e) {
    if (!e.target.classList.contains('header__link_active'))
      e.target.classList.add('header__link_active')
      e.target.nextElementSibling ? e.target.nextElementSibling.classList.remove('header__link_active')
      : e.target.previousElementSibling.classList.remove('header__link_active')
  }
```
